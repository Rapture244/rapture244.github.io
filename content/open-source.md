**Role:** Co-Creator & Lead Maintainer

**PyGraft-gen** is an open-source Python library for **generating RDFS/OWL ontologies and RDF Knowledge Graphs at scale**.

It enables researchers and practitioners to create synthetic data with reliable knowledge structure and characteristic graph patterns. This is essential for testing AI pipelines, benchmarking graph algorithms, and advancing research in domains where real data is sensitive or unavailable.

PyGraft-gen is an evolution of the [PyGraft](https://github.com/nicolas-hbt/pygraft) project, with two major advances: 
- **real-world ontology extraction** 
- **large-scale performance optimization**
