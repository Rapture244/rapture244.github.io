---

I'm a Software Engineer in the DATA-AI entity at [Orange Innovation](https://hellofuture.orange.com/), where I bridge research and delivery. I work alongside researchers, helping them transition their mathematical models and optimization algorithms into production systems that address concrete operational challenges.

My work spans **Knowledge Engineering**, **Operational Research**, and **Graph Theory**. I specialize in Semantic Web technologies (Knowledge Graphs, ontologies) and network optimization, tackling both research problems and their operational deployment.

In connection with my work, I'm also interested in:

- DevOps & Software Craftsmanship
- Data Science & Engineering (ML, pipelines, analytics)
- Distributed & Scalable Systems
